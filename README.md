## Project Overview
Emergency department (ED) readmissions, especially among patients with mental health conditions, are a critical concern. High readmission rates not only strain ED resources but also signal gaps in continuity of care, driving up costs and increasing patient risk. This project analyzes ED data to identify the key drivers of readmissions for patients diagnosed with mental health-related disorders. The goal is to equip ED leadership with actionable insights to prioritize high-risk patients, optimize workflows, and design targeted interventions that reduce avoidable readmissions and improve overall care delivery.
