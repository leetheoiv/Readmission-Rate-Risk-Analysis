## Project Overview
This project investigates the risk factors associated with high readmission rates in the Emergency Department (ED) for patients diagnosed with a mental health condition. High readmission rates are indicative of poor operational performance and are often linked to increased patient mortality, hospital-acquired conditions, higher patient costs, overcrowding, and a greater overall burden on the healthcare system. By analyzing readmission data, this project aims to identify the key risk factors contributing to higher readmission rates, with the goal of developing targeted interventions and prioritizing patients to help reduce ED readmissions.
## Objectives
- Compare admission rates between mental health diagnoses and other medical conditions.
- Analyze time trends in mental health readmission rates.
- Investigate the relationship between readmission rates and  mortality.
- Identify which mental health diagnoses have the highest readmission rates.
- Examine disparities in readmission rates across racial, age, and gender groups.
- Explore the interaction between marital status and readmission rates.
- Investigate diagnoses with the highest readmission rates in detail.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to reduce readmission rates.
